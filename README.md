# NP-solution-for-prime-number-determination
####This code has been written to determine whether a number is prime or not, by NP approach. 
####In this code, I am using a random() method to genereate a number such that it is less than half of the given number. Then we check for the divisibility. If divisibility succeeds I call the function Success() else call the Failure.
####Due to use of random() in the code, there is some randomness. Because of this sometimes the generated solution may not 100% valid. But due to NP approach, we cannot eliminate this error. Benefit of this approach is that it is able to generate a solution in very less time compared to conventional approach. Hence, the time complexity of the algorithm decreases.
